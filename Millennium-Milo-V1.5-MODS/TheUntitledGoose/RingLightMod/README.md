### Of Primary Importance ! 
**Please** don't make this unless you are sure you know what you are doing !. 

It's not "Ready for Prime Time Yet" - > I only realised after I placed the order with JLC that I had used the **65mm Spindle**, Not the 80mm spindle in Fusion to derrive the sizes of this.

( They were placed atop each other in Fusion, and I thought that it was just a "Funky Accent" not nested atop each other )

**To Remedy this** 
I am planning on making a 3D Printed adapter plate, so I can still use the 65mm on my 80mm spindle. It just needs to be "Stood off" to down by the spinny bit of the spindle. 

Will add photos when my "Batch One" drop arrives. 


### Issues with the Gerbers 

I noticed as well, when I got my PCBs back from JLC, that some of the drills have not been performed on the barell jack mount. This was my first project in KiCad, not Eagle or Altium, So, Naturally it wouldn't be perfect either. 

Will look at fixing once I have proved it works. 

### Changes to STLs

I've had to sink some Heated Inserts into the Base STL for the Spindle. 
I have done that in "SMH 80mm part B Modified.3mf"
